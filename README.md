# Resume-Parser

This project allows you to specify a URL of LLM model and file path of your resume, then execute various methods to process the data of Resume using an IPython notebook (.ipynb file).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   https://github.com/swebalaji/Resume-Parser.git
   cd repository

2. **Install Dependencies:**

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed, then install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.  **Specify URL and File Path:**

Before running the notebook, you need to specify the URL of your LLM model(I used the Mistral Model loaded via Bedrcok) and the file path of Resume in pdf format in the notebook itself or in a configuration file.

URL: http://example.com/data
File Path: path/to/your/file

4.   **Run the Notebook:**
Navigate to your_notebook.ipynb and run the cells in the notebook. Make sure to update the cells where you specify the URL and file path.

**Example Usage**
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to use the notebook with the specified URL and file path:

1)Open your_notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

2)Update the cells with the correct URL and file path.

3)Run the cells to execute the methods.
